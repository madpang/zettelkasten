@details:
Linux-based server setup is a common task in software development and deployment.
In modern development, it may present itself as docker container setup, or as a virtual machine setup, etc.
Based on different use cases, the setup may have different emphasis.

=== Ticket 2

@brief: Write about the use of Git

@details:
Git is essential in modern software development.
There are already plenty of resources on the web about Git.
However, `git` has grown to be a complex tool, and it is not uncommon that even experienced developers sometimes forget how to achieve a specific task with it.
I would like to write a series of posts about Git, in documentary fiction style, to cover the frequent practical usage scenarios of Git.
Moreover, I would like to explore the concept of version control in more depth.

etc.

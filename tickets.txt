@details:
Linux-based server setup is a common task in software development and deployment.
In modern development, it may present itself as docker container setup, or as a virtual machine setup, etc.
Based on different use cases, the setup may have different emphasis.

=== Ticket 2

@brief: Write about the use of Git

@status: IN-PROGRESS

@date:

@details:
Git is essential in modern software development.
There are already plenty of resources on the web about Git.
However, `git` has grown to be a complex tool, and it is not uncommon that even experienced developers sometimes forget how to achieve a specific task with it.
I would like to write a series of posts about Git, in documentary fiction style, to cover the frequent practical usage scenarios of Git.
Moreover, I would like to explore the concept of version control in more depth.

=== Ticket 3

@brief: Write about some CLI tips

@status: TODO

@details:
Want to find a file in a directory tree by its name?
What to find a text file by several keywords in it?
etc.

=== Ticket 4

@brief: Write about Java development with Gradle.

@status: TODO

@date:

- updated on 2025-07-06

@details:
Java is a popular programming language.
It is a mature language, and has a large ecosystem, and a long history.
Many developers may thought that Java is a little bit old-fashioned, but with the rise of the AI agent/copilot, I think that Java will benefit from it.
Gradle, well, honest to say, I am new to gradle---I am a C++ developer who has been using CMake for years---I thought that Gradle is a modern build system for Java.

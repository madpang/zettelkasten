# Setup NFS Server for Local Network File Sharing

My workflow involves a multi-workspace setup, where I usually works on a MacBook Pro as *THE TERMINAL*---enjoying its *Liquid Retina XDR* display and the aesthetic of macOS for coding, writing, and graphic design---while using a Linux machine as the server for heavy lifting tasks, such as long-run simulation, batch data processing, machine learning, etc.

This guide provides steps to set up a Network File System (NFS) server on a Ubuntu machine and how to mount it from a macOS client.
